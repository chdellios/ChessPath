My implementation of the Java application where the user is  able to enter a starting position and an ending position. 
The application calculates a list of all possible paths that one knight piece (can be extended to all pieces of the chess) 
in the starting position could take to reach the ending position. 
The user can input the number of the maximum moves a piece can make in order to reach the ending position. 
Some inputs might not have a solution, in this case the program returns null.
